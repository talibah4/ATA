		<p>Born and raised in Jersey City, New Jersey, Angi The Artist has had a natural draw to music since her childhood days of listening to Arabic music when running day-to-day errands with her Egyptian-born mother. Her interests intensified when introduced to popular American musicians of the early 90s such as The Notorious B.I.G., Aaliyah, Boyz II Men, Tupac, and The Fugees. What attracted her most to music, especially when listening to Arabic music, were not only lyrics but also the emotions expressed throughout songs. She was captivated by artists’ ability to deliver human emotions and to really bring lyrics to life. Although she often found herself steadily focusing on these traits when listening to music, combined with an early discovery of a poetic and creative writer’s voice, the inspiration to potentially actualize a career as a lyricist/songwriter did not come to her until after she graduated college.</p>
		
		<!--<p>The thought of being a recording artist herself did not cross her mind 
		until her early 20's. What attracted her the most to musical composition
		was not only lyrical content, but the way in how words were being delivered & 
		the emotions behind them. After high school she headed west to attend California State 
		University Long Beach, and pursue a degree in Film and Electronic Arts. Following graduation
		during post-production of her senior thesis film, Angi became inspired to start developing 
		and honing the skill sets of Hip Hop music.</p>
	
		<p>Now an aspiring rapper, she considers her music to be conceptual pieces of art
		that make references to social, political, and gender-related issues. Also in her mix
		are songs that are fun and upbeat, and that tie cinematic & cultural references. Angi the
		Artist considers herself a devoted student of this craft and an avid soldier of lyricism.</p>-->
        
        <p> With these profound interests in music and creative writing, Angi headed west to attend California State University Long Beach to study film with a pursuit to become a screenwriter. But following college graduation during post-production of her senior-thesis film, Angi finally became triggered to start developing and honing the skill-set of lyricism and hip hop music. Although she owes much of her inspiration to the legendary and contemporary rappers and musicians she studied, she also heavily credits historical religious figures like Jesus and prophet Muhammad for igniting her drive. Now an aspiring rapper/singer, she considers her music to be conceptual pieces of art. Although music is currently her main focus, Angi still upholds a passion for film and aspires to ultimately leverage music with a career as a director, screenwriter, actress, and cinematographer.

        Although she puts her love for music above her love for film, and claims to be an avid soldier
		of lyricism, Angi The Artist also considers herself an overall artist who in the future hopes to
		bridge a career in Hip-Hop with a career in film and television production. She aspires to be
		a director, cinematographer, screenwriter, and actress, as well as become a social activist for
		disenfranchised people and communities.-->
